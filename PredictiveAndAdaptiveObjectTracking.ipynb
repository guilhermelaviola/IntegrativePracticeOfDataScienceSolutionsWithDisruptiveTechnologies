        "Object tracking in videos presents significant challenges due to changing perspectives and unpredictable appearance variations, as exemplified in a bustling retail environment like Target during a sale. Traditional tracking methods, reliant on correlation techniques and manual feature extraction, face limitations under adverse conditions, such as sudden angle shifts or lighting changes. The advent of deep learning, particularly regression networks, marks a pivotal advancement by enabling the prediction of object locations in future frames. These networks learn to anticipate complex movements, allowing for accurate tracking even amid rapid changes, like customers swiftly moving items or abrupt shifts in camera angles. This predictive and adaptive capability enhances tracking robustness and efficiency, demonstrating its critical value in active scenarios, especially within high-traffic retail settings.​"
