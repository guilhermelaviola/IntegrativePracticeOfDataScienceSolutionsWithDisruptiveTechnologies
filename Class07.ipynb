        "# **Time Series Analysis in Python**\n",
        "Time series analysis involves examining datasets collected over time to identify patterns like trends and seasonality. In Python, libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for statistical functions, and Matplotlib for visualization are essential. The ARIMA model (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is commonly used for forecasting stationary time series; it requires tests for stationarity, such as the ADF test. Depending on the results, transformations may be necessary. Key parameters of ARIMA include p (autoregressive order), d (differencing order), and q (moving average order), which can be determined through functions like \"auto_arima\" or ACF/PACF plots. Once developed, the model's accuracy is assessed using error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Overall, time series analysis is crucial for understanding and forecasting time-dependent data."
